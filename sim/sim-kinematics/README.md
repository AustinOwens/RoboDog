# Kinematics Simulation

Here is the kinematics simulation for the Robodog Project. This Simulator will
allow users to run simulations of the Robodog Project manipulators. This Project
uses a mixture of Python and C++ in order to accomplish the underlying goal of
efficiency and simplicity. Simple interfaces for easy calls and stacking in python
with the efficiency of compiled c++ for repetitive libraries. 

## Getting Started
To Start run the following in your bash terminal

```bash
$ . setup.py
```
This will give you some options including `build`.

This is the next thing you should run to build and test the project. It will pull down two externs for you pybind11 and Eigen. 

Here are some dependencies:
`python3, cmake, matplotlib numpy`
each should be installed somewhere in your workspace.
